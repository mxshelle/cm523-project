            <p> In August 2009, Tesfaye began to release music on YouTube anonymously; in 2010, he met producer Jeremy Rose, 
                who pitched a dark contemporary R&B musical project. Rose helped produce three songs—“What You Need”, “Loft
                Music”, and “The Morning”—and although they were initially scrapped, Rose allowed Tesfaye to keep the tracks 
                under the condition he would be credited for them. In December 2010, Tesfaye uploaded the tracks onto a 
                YouTube channel, “xoxxxoooxo.” Through word of mouth and a blog post from Drake, the songs would garner 
                attention and ultimately, media coverage from numerous media outlets like Pitchfork and the New York Times.
            </p>
            <p> In 2011, Tesfaye and La Mar met with music executives Wassim "Sal" Slaiby and Amir "Cash" Esmailian to 
                establish the XO record label. On March 21 of that year, Tesfaye released his debut mixtape <span class="i">House of Balloons</span> 
                as a free download on his website. On August 18, he released a second mixtape—<span class="i">Thursday</span>—and on December 21, he 
                released his third mixtape, <span class="i">Echoes of Silence</span>. These three free mixtapes, his first live performance at the Mod 
                Club Theatre in Toronto, and an extensive collaboration with Drake on his second studio album helped kickstart 
                Tesfaye's career into the mainstream and grow his budding fanbase.
