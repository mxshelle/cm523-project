            <p> On May 27, 2015, Tesfaye revealed a new song, “The Hills,” which would eventually become the second single on 
                <span class="i">Beauty Behind the Madness</span>. The song debuted at number twenty on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100" target="_blank">Billboard Hot 100</a> and peaked at number one. 
                A later release on June 8, “Can't Feel My Face,” continued his string of successful singles and also topped the 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100" target="_blank">Billboard Hot 100</a> charts. Tesfaye's second studio album <span class="i">Beauty Behind the Madness</span> came out on August 28 and 
                immediately saw success: it debuted at number one on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_200" target="_blank">Billboard 200</a>; charted in the top ten among several 
                other countries; and eventually, it would win a Grammy for Best Urban Contemporary Album. To promote the album, 
                Tesfaye headlined at various summer music festivals and kicked off The Madness Fall Tour, his first large-scale 
                tour in U.S. arenas.
            </p>
            <p> Leading up to his third studio album, Tesfaye continued to collaborate with artists: he featured on Travis Scott's 
                debut album <span class="i2">Rodeo</span>, on Kanye West's seventh studio album <span class="i2">The Life of Pablo</span>, on Future's <span class="i2">Evol</span>, and on Beyonce's 
                <span class="i2">Lemonade</span> album. In September 2016, Tesfaye announced his newest album <span class="i">Starboy</span>, to be released on November 25. The 
                title track “Starboy,” which featured electronic music duo Daft Punk, was released ahead of the album on September 
                21 and once again, peaked at number one on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100" target="_blank">Billboard Hot 100</a>; a second collaboration with Daft Punk, “I Feel It 
                Coming,” was released on November 24. <span class="i">Starboy</span> debuted as number one on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_200" target="_blank">Billboard 200</a> as well—becoming his second 
                consecutive number-one album—and since its release, it has accumulated over 150 million streams and has been 
                certified triple-platinum by the RIAA. It also won Tesfaye his second Grammy win for Best Urban Contemporary Album 
                with prominent features such as Kendrick Lamar, Lana Del Ray, and Future. In support of the album, Tesfaye began
                his tour, Starboy: Legend of the Fall Tour, in February 2017. He visited cities across Europe, North America, 
                South America, and Oceania, and concluded the tour in December.
