            <p> Throughout his career, The Weeknd has been noted for his distinctive voice, his introspective and often 
                explicit lyrics, and his willingness to experiment with different genres and styles. He has since established 
                himself as one of the most innovative and influential artists of his generation and his work continues to be 
                prominent today. In February 2021, Tesfaye headlined the Super Bowl LV halftime show, becoming the first 
                Canadian solo artist to do so. Following his performance, After Hours and the other songs he performed all 
                saw an explosive growth in streams and downloads.
            </p>
            <p> Tesfaye's fifth studio album, <span class="i">Dawn FM</span>, was released on January 7, 2022. The album was a major factor in his 
                latest tour, the After Hours til Dawn Tour, and many elements from his albums After Hours and Dawn FM were 
                incorporated into it. The tour is his seventh concert tour and primarily visits stadiums from across the world. 
                Although the North American leg of the tour recently wrapped up, Tesfaye has plans to also visit South America, 
                Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Australia.
            </p>
            <p> As of today, The Weeknd continues to be wildly successful. He has been dubbed the “most popular musician on 
                the planet” by Guinness World Records, among other media organizations that tout his reach and influence. 
                Currently, Tesfaye has over 100 million monthly active listeners on Spotify and is the first artist to reach 
                this momentous milestone—despite only being 33, he has broken countless records and accumulated many accolades 
                and his trajectory will only continue upward.
