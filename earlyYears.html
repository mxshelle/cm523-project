            <p> The Weeknd, whose real name is Abel Makkonen Tesfaye, was born on February 16, 1990, in the Scarborough 
              area of Toronto, Canada. Tesfaye's parents were both Ethiopian immigrants who had come to Canada in the 
              1980s. His father abandoned the family when Tesfaye was just a toddler and because his mother worked long 
              hours at multiple jobs to support the family, Tesfaye was largely raised by his maternal grandmother. As 
              a result of his maternal grandmother's influence, Tesfaye was raised as an Ethiopian Orthodox and his native 
              language is Amharic. He cites the traditional Ethiopian music he once listened to as one of his earliest 
              musical influences.
            </p>
            <p> Growing up, Tesfaye was exposed to various drugs. At 11, he started smoking marijuana before moving on to 
              hard drugs: MDMA, Xanax, cocaine, psilocybin, and ketamine. Although he attended high school, Tesfaye failed 
              to graduate, dropping out of school at 17 and moving to an apartment in Parkdale with two of his best friends
              —one of these friends, La Mar Taylor, would later become his creative director. His dropout status would inspire 
              his stage moniker, The Weeknd, representative of the fact that he “left one weekend and never came back home.” 
              During this time, Tesfaye would experience homelessness and incarceration and continued to abuse drugs.
