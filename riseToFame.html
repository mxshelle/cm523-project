            <p> During the early months of 2012, Tesfaye began a string of performances: between January and March, he visited 
                several Ontario universities; in April, he launched his first international tour with a performance at Coachella. 
                In September, Tesfaye's record label XO would become a subsidiary under Republic Records which he himself would 
                sign with. Soon after, in November, he released Trilogy, a compilation album consisting of his remastered 2011 
                mixtapes and three additional tracks; unlike the mixtapes, the album also officially credited Rose as a producer 
                and writer. Trilogy had an impressive debut—number four on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart—and was certified platinum 
                by the RIAA a few months later.
            </p>
            <p> On May 16, 2013, Tesfaye released “Kiss Land,” the title track to his debut album Kiss Land which was to be 
                released on September 10. The success he had with Trilogy continued with Kiss Land—the album came in at number two 
                on Billboard 200 and received generally positive feedback. During this time, Tesfaye expanded his realm of work: 
                he opened for Justin Timberlake's fifth concert tour; he took part in the soundtrack to The Hunger Games: Catching 
                Fire; and in September 2014, he collaborated with Ariana Grande on her second studio album with the wildly popular 
                song “Love Me Harder.”
            </p>
            <p> In June, Tesfaye released a new song, “Often,” on Spotify—a song that would later be on his Beauty Behind the 
                Madness album. This was followed by the announcement of his first headlining tour, the King of the Fall tour, 
                which would feature supporting acts Schoolboy Q and Jhene Aiko and begin in September. Another song—“King of the 
                Fall”—was released in July to promote his upcoming tour of the same name, and in December 2014, Tesfaye would 
                release a single for the Fifty Shades of Grey soundtrack, “Earned It,” which peaked at number three on the U.S 
                Billboard Hot 100 and amassed various nominations at the Grammys and Academy Awards.
