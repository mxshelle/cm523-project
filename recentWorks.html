            <p> On February 2, 2018, Tesfaye was featured on the <span class="i2">Black Panther</span> soundtrack: his song, “Pray for Me,” was in 
                collaboration with Kendrick Lamar and peaked at number seven on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100" target="_blank">Billboard Hot 100</a>. On March 30th, 2018, 
                Tesfaye debuted his first EP—<span class="i">My Dear Melancholy</span>. The EP would extend his number of consecutive chart-topping 
                albums and became his fourth consecutive number-one on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_200" target="_blank">Billboard 200</a>. 
            </p>
            <p> Tesfaye's fourth studio album, <span class="i">After Hours</span>, was teased on November 24, 2019, with a snippet of his single 
                “Blinding Lights” being used in a Mercede-Benz commercial. 3 days later, he released “Heartless,” the album's 
                lead single; two days later on November 29, “Blinding Lights” was officially released. “Heartless” and 
                “Blinding Lights”, respectively, became his fourth and fifth number-one singles on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100" target="_blank">Billboard Hot 100</a>; 
                notably, Blinding Lights would become the first song in the chart's history to remain in the top ten for an 
                entire year and was the longest charting song of all-time, charting for 90 weeks by the time of its departure 
                from the Hot 100.
            </p>
            <p> On February 19, 2020, Tesfaye released “Blinding Lights” as the title track to his upcoming album. Shortly 
                afterward, he appeared on Saturday Night Live as a musical guest to promote the new record as well as a new 
                song, “Scared to Live.” <span class="i">After Hours</span> was eventually released in March. The album received widespread critical 
                acclaim and was a commercial success—upon its release, it topped the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_200" target="_blank">Billboard 200</a> chart and would become 
                the most streamed R&B album of all time, passing Tesfaye's own <span class="i">Starboy</span> album.
