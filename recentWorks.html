            <p> On February 2, 2018, Tesfaye was featured on the Black Panther soundtrack: his song, “Pray for Me,” was in 
                collaboration with Kendrick Lamar and peaked at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100. On March 30th, 2018, 
                Tesfaye debuted his first EP—My Dear Melancholy. The EP would extend his number of consecutive chart-topping 
                albums and became his fourth consecutive number-one on the Billboard 200. 
            </p>
            <p> Tesfaye's fourth studio album, After Hours, was teased on November 24, 2019, with a snippet of his single 
                “Blinding Lights” being used in a Mercede-Benz commercial. 3 days later, he released “Heartless,” the album's 
                lead single; two days later on November 29, “Blinding Lights” was officially released. “Heartless” and 
                “Blinding Lights”, respectively, became his fourth and fifth number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100; 
                notably, Blinding Lights would become the first song in the chart's history to remain in the top ten for an 
                entire year and was the longest charting song of all-time, charting for 90 weeks by the time of its departure 
                from the Hot 100.
            </p>
            <p> On February 19, 2020, Tesfaye released “Blinding Lights” as the title track to his upcoming album. Shortly 
                afterward, he appeared on Saturday Night Live as a musical guest to promote the new record as well as a new 
                song, “Scared to Live.” After Hours was eventually released in March. The album received widespread critical 
                acclaim and was a commercial success—upon its release, it topped the Billboard 200 chart and would become 
                the most streamed R&B album of all time, passing Tesfaye's own Starboy album.
